Mono (Conway's) Game Of Life v0.5

Converted this toy project from SDL to MonoGame. Lots of quick hackish things to get it working from my SDL Version.
Does not have the performace of SDL and input is very quirky. This will be fixed in upcoming commits.

As far as I know Mac only. 

Draw using the left mouse button. 
Press space bar to start the game of life.

Watch simple evolution and enjoy!
